# Airbnb-PricePrediction

In this project, I grab the data from http://data.insideairbnb.com/the-netherlands/north-holland/amsterdam/2021-04-09/data/listings.csv.gz and try to predict Airbnb listing price for Amsterdam. By the time I made the project, I wasn't equiped with data mining and machine learning skills so the focus of this project is to demonstrate my Python skills in data wrangling and manipulation, including imputing null values, converting data columns to appropriate data type to save memory, feature engineering, and running regressiong with OLS method.
